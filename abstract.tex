Version Control Systems have, for many years, been area of applications that
are developed and maintained with software engineering in mind. However, other
less technical industries and endeavors can benefit immensely from the
functionality these systems provide. Existing systems such as Git and SVN have
too steep a learning curve to make quick adoption feasible. Other, less
complex, applications such as Dropbox and Google Drive do not offer the same
level of power as their software-minded counterparts. Even novice programmers
are left using less than ideal systems to avoid sinking time into learning
unnecessarily complex systems. In this thesis, I provide two main contributions,
both in the context of Snapstore, the proposed system. I outline the steps 
needed to design a simpler, more powerful Version Control System by following 
the guidelines of conceptual software design. I then describe the proprietary 
technologies and algorithms I created to fulfill the vision of a universal, 
simple Version Control System. Snapstore is the embodiment of all the goals 
and ideals described by this paper.
