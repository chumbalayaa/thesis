Version control systems have, for many years, been applications that are developed and maintained with software engineering in mind. However, other less technical industries and endeavors can benefit immensely from the functionality these systems provide. Existing systems such as Git and SVN have too steep a learning curve to make quick adoption feasible. Less complex file syncing applications such as Dropbox and Google Drive do not offer the same level of power as their software-minded counterparts. Even novice programmers are left using less than ideal systems to avoid sinking time into learning unnecessarily complex systems. In this thesis, we provide two main contributions, both in the context of Snapstore, the proposed system. We outline the steps needed to design a simpler, more powerful version control system by following the theory of conceptual design. We then describe the proprietary technologies and algorithms we created to fulfill the vision of a universal, simple version control system. Snapstore is the result of all the goals and ideals described by this paper.
