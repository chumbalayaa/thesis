\chapter{Conclusion}

Snapstore is a version control system that tries to bridge the gap between version control systems and file syncing systems to being the best of both worlds to users. Its motivating purpose is to be simple enough for every user and powerful enough for every user. By following the theory of conceptual design, we believe Snapstore's design has acheived that.

Snapstore still has implementation-specific needs and flaws which will need to be addressed before it is widely used. By open-sourcing this project, we hope it development will continue and its full design is realized.
