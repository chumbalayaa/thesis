\subsection{Platform Testing}

Although Snapstore is built on a cross-platform framework, there will need to be testing done on those platforms. A common concern with cross-platform frameworks is their poor performance on those platforms. Snapstore will need performance testing for these platforms to make sure that it is compatible with them. Any issues in performace or function will be identified during this process and remedied with additional libraries and/or performace improvements.

Another common issue with cross-platform frameworks is the interface differences between platforms. Some front end components can look and behave differently on different platforms. Much like in a web app, these differences can be handled with logic in the front end that distinguishes between platforms and delivers the appropriate code.
