\subsection{Saving Changes - Snapshots}
Snapshots.

The snapshot tree is a one-dimensional history of changes to a file in the Snapstore system. For a unique (branch, file) tuple, there is one snapshot tree, populated by snapshots. 

Snapshots are related by parent and child pointers.

Snapshots in this tree all have the same basic model.
