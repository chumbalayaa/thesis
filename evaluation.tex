\chapter{Evaluation}

A report on our personal experiences using Snapstore for the past few months is included below. Ideas for future evaluations can be found in section 7.2.

\section{Usability}

\subsection{Conveniences}

\subsubsection{Interface Space}

Snapstore is able to fit all of the concepts into the application with an overall small interface, slightly smaller than that of Github's client application. %This can be attributed to the bare bones conceptual design of Snapstore and the methodical placement of these concepts in the interface itself.

\subsubsection{File and Snapshot Tree Navigation}

Snapstore's built-in file navigation makes it simple to search through all of the files within the Snapstore folder. This makes it easy to locate snapshot graphs, and having all the functionality of Snapstore in one place is convenient.

\subsubsection{Working with Branches}

Branch creation and switching between branches are both one-click operations. Because the file system changes with respect to the current branch, there is never any confusion about which branch's file the user is working on.

\subsubsection{Automatic Saving}

Because snapshots are automatically taken, there's no need to manually save your work. Reverting to a previous snapshot is another one-click operation, and it edits the user's filesystem so that their computer and Snapstore are always in agreement about the contents of files.

\subsection{Issues}

\subsubsection{Snapshot Graph Search}

The number of snapshots taken results in a cluttered interface. The snapshot graph loses meaning when there are too many snapshots to navigate it effectively, and it makes searching through the snapshot graph inefficient.

\subsubsection{Cloned Branch Snapshot Selection}

During the cloning of a branch, selecting which snapshots to being over is difficult for the same reason: there are too many snapshots. Choosing subsets of snapshots to copy is inefficient.

\subsubsection{Operations for Each File in Interface}

For each file in the UI, there is both a file icon and a file name, but the function that clicking the file name performs is not clear. It opens the snapshot graph for that file, but there are no affordances for this functionality.
